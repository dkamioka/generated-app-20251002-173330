# User Management System with RBAC and Admin Dashboard

This PR introduces a comprehensive user management system with role-based access control, authentication, and a full admin dashboard interface.

## 🎯 Overview

This implementation includes three major components:
1. **Phase 1**: Backend user management system with RBAC
2. **Database Configuration**: Cloudflare D1 setup
3. **Phase 4**: Frontend admin dashboard UI

## ✨ Features Implemented

### Phase 1: Backend User Management System

#### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ JWT-based authentication with Web Crypto API (HMAC-SHA256)
- ✅ Google OAuth integration for seamless login
- ✅ First-user-becomes-admin logic (automatic)
- ✅ Token refresh mechanism
- ✅ Banned user blocking at middleware level

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- ✅ Three role types: **Admin**, **Moderator**, **User**
- ✅ Four tier types: **Free**, **Paid**, **Lifetime**, **Beta**
- ✅ Permission system with feature gating
- ✅ Admin middleware with self-action prevention
- ✅ Comprehensive audit logging

#### Database Schema (Cloudflare D1)
```sql
- users                  -- User accounts with roles and tiers
- subscription_events    -- Payment history and subscription events
- admin_actions         -- Audit log of all admin actions
- sessions              -- JWT token tracking
- game_stats_cache      -- Analytics aggregation
```

#### API Endpoints (13 new)
**Authentication:**
- `POST /api/auth/google` - Google OAuth login
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Refresh JWT token

**User Profile:**
- `PATCH /api/users/me` - Update user profile

**Admin - User Management:**
- `GET /api/admin/users` - List users (paginated, searchable, filterable)
- `GET /api/admin/users/:id` - Get user details
- `PATCH /api/admin/users/:id/role` - Change user role
- `POST /api/admin/users/:id/ban` - Ban user with reason
- `POST /api/admin/users/:id/unban` - Unban user
- `DELETE /api/admin/users/:id` - Delete user

**Admin - Analytics:**
- `GET /api/admin/analytics/overview` - Dashboard statistics
- `GET /api/admin/audit-log` - View admin action history

#### Permission System
```typescript
// Feature gating by tier
- Free tier: 3 concurrent games, easy AI only, 10 game history
- Paid/Lifetime/Beta: Unlimited games, all AI levels, unlimited history

// Role-based permissions
- Admin: Full access to all features
- Moderator: Chat moderation, game management
- User: Standard game features
```

### Phase 4: Admin Dashboard UI

#### User Management Interface
- ✅ **Paginated user table** (20 users per page)
- ✅ **Search functionality** (by email or name)
- ✅ **Filters** (by role and tier)
- ✅ **User detail modal** with:
  - Profile information
  - One-click role changes
  - Ban/unban with custom reason
  - Delete user (with confirmation)
- ✅ **Status badges** (color-coded by role, tier, status)
- ✅ **Avatar display**
- ✅ **Responsive design** (mobile, tablet, desktop)

#### Analytics Dashboard
- ✅ Total users count
- ✅ Active users (last 30 days)
- ✅ Paid users count
- ✅ Total games count
- ✅ Clean card-based layout

#### State Management
- ✅ **Enhanced userStore** - Full authentication with JWT
- ✅ **New adminStore** - Admin state management with Zustand
- ✅ **API client** - Type-safe admin API functions
- ✅ **Optimistic updates** - Instant UI feedback

#### Security & UX
- ✅ Admin-only access with automatic redirect
- ✅ Full dark mode support
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ Modal interactions
- ✅ Inline editing without page refresh

# Generate and set JWT secret
GENERATED_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
echo "$GENERATED_SECRET" | npx wrangler secret put JWT_SECRET

# Optional: Set Google OAuth credentials
echo "YOUR_CLIENT_ID" | npx wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
echo "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" | npx wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
```
